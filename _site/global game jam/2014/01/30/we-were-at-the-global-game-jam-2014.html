	  <p>During this last weekend, we (Rafael, Gabriel and João Vitor) participated in the GGJ 2014. It was super fun and creative... And insane.</p>
<p>I'll be talking a little bit about the feeling of creating a game in two days and, perhaps, give some tips to other people who are willing to participate on such event (like Ludum Dare, as well). I'm not sure about the other guys, so I'll be talking on my (Rafael's) perspective.</p>
<p><!--more--></p>
<p>I didn't know what to expect from the event. I was just anxious cause I've never actually finished a game, and suddenly I needed to make one from scratch in only two days. So on the week before, I spent almost all of my time reading blogs and preparing my codelibrary of code so nothing would be wrong on the technical side (as if that is possible.)</p>
<p>Arriving at the event, we watched some lectures about tips on surviving the event, which were really useful. After that, the theme was sent to us: "<strong>We don't see things as they are, we see them as we are.</strong>"</p>
<p>And that was it, we were kicked off to grab our keys for lockers to keep our stuff. We took the time to meet other people and talk about the theme. <a title="Bettina Calmon" href="http://bettinacalmon.blogspot.com.br/" target="_blank">We even found the music composer of the 8bit world of the latest Intel game.</a></p>
<p>After that, we didn't really know where to start. So we just went to our lockers, separated the necessary material, found a room, and went on to the brainstorm!</p>
<p>After almost two hours of discussion. We decided to gather the theme around a little happy kid with cancer and change the environment depending of the mood of the child. Put in mind that we changed the concept and removed/added things a lot.</p>
<p>It was basically 9pm when we started the actual work. Gabriel (designer) started working on the art of the character while I (programmer) started the basic physics of the world and map creation. By around 8am <em>(yes, 11h of coding)</em>, we had a system for creating maps and character animation. It took me long to do those things 'cause I was using <a title="Awesome game SDK" href="http://libgdx.badlogicgames.com/" target="_blank">LibGDX</a>, even though this is a great tool for creating games, you have to be very proficient and creative to code the games. Cause the only way to create games with this tool is by using CODE. <em><a title="No programming is required!" href="https://www.scirra.com/manual/1/construct-2" target="_blank"><del>(Is there another way?)</del></a></em></p>
<p>When it was around 10am, I decided to take some sleep. Gabriel slept around 6am to 8am. After I woke up, around 12am, we had lunch and discussed a bit more about the event and the game we were making. I was particularly worried that I would actually not finish the game.</p>
<p>When we got back, we worked on the level design of the game and started adding new stuff to it, in general. We had to cut several mechanics that we wanted to have in the game.</p>
<p>When the event was almost done, we didn't have an actual game. What we had was an interactive concept for a future game. And we are going to work on this beautiful concept throghout the future months and hope you'll enjoy it.</p>
<p>In general, the Global Game Jam is an event for everyone. In fact, the GGJ is an event for everyone who wants to create something. Know how to program? Draw? Paint? Digitally draw or paint? Compose music? Write about stuff? Then the Global Game Jam is for you. I highly recommend it to the creative minds. It doesn't actually matter if you think your game will "suck". Just go to the event, meet new people, learn other stuff. More than fourteen thousand people participated of the jam, do you really think that they are all professional game creators?</p>
<p>I thought I was not going to be able to create anything on the jam, but the event surprised me, gathering creative people under the same roof and pushing themselves to the limit. This event also showed me what I want to do for my entire life, 'cause creating something in this two days and not feel tired at all is an amazing feeling.</p>
<p>I think I'll be taking Ludum Dares while I still need to wait another year for the next GGJ.</p>
<p>I'd like to thank João Vitor, Sarah Moraes, Bettina Calmon (main theme) and Leonardo (my brother) for the support on the event... And not forget <a href="https://soundcloud.com/lizzi-cloverman/" target="_blank">Lizzi Cloverman</a>, for the ending theme</p>
