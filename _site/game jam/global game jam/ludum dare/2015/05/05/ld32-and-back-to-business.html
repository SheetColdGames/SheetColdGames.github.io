	  <p>Oh wow, is this right again? The last update was... (1, 2, 3, 4, 5...) six months ago?? Yes, it was. First we'll start by apologizing the lack of posts and all, but we all have our little personal problems, right? Right?</p>
<p>Anyway, in this blog post we'll be talking about what we're up to and what we've done. So here it comes. As usual, I'll be talking through my (Rafael) perspective.</p>
<p><!--more--></p>
<h2>What changed after a year of Ludum Dare?</h2>
<p>Well, a lot of things have changed since the last time I entered a Ludum Dare, which was last year. I thought to myself that game jams could be cool and I didn't notice back in that time but I was definitely not ready for a game jam. The only time I'd done anything related to a jam was at the <a title="We were at the Global Game Jam 2014!!!" href="/global game jam/2014/01/30/we-were-at-the-global-game-jam-2014.html" target="_blank">GGJ 2014</a> and I thought I could make something cause, hell, it's been 3 months since the GGJ, I can TOTALLY make a game in 3 days. My mindset was still not focused on gameplay, but on delivering stories and emotions through images and music. My lack of experience with any programming tool forced me into trying to find any shortcut in order to deliver what I wanted to. But I noticed what happened back in the day only now. There are differences between the technical approach to game development and the way people perceive games. One is actually a clearer subject than another, but the point here is that I had to actually understand what I was doing or it would be hard to move on.</p>
<p>So what really changed in one year? As a person, I can't say that much has really changed, but my view about games are somewhat different, I feel like this might be the actual start of everything that we want to create. Anyway, let's talk about this LD32.</p>
<h2>The theme was announced, we didn't actually feel good about it</h2>
<p>Me and Gabriel had been talking about taking a break from our current project to actually give 72h of our time to LD, but we didn't consider that the theme could be something that we didn't want to make. I followed all the rounds of elimination of the themes, picking the ones I liked and downvoting the ones I didn't like only to notice that a theme which had won one of the rounds had the most votes out of all rounds. This made me feel a bit worried, but I always hold my hopes up in terms of wanting things, so I waited. When the theme was announced, that's what we got:</p>
<p>"<strong>An Unconventional Weapon</strong>".</p>
<p>This has got to be the worst theme of all LDs I followed ever since two and a half years ago. I saw a lot of people on twitter giving up when they realized this was the theme and it all was pretty divided, some people loved it a lot and some people hated it a lot. We didn't like the theme, but we had already announced that we were going to participate, so what were we up to do? Bail? Face it?</p>
<p>Well, we decided it was good for us to just participate. We came up with a lot of regular, shitty and 18+ ideas, some of them included a character holding a mirror (<a title="Mirroir du Mort" href="http://ludumdare.com/compo/2015/04/20/miroir-du-mort-third-and-almost-final-build/comment-page-1/" target="_blank">wow, did somebody ACTUALLY made a game about this?</a>) eventually it had passed 5 hours and I didn't make anything for the game and Gabriel was doodling with a limited palette. We didn't notice back then, but that procrastination would make for some amazing practice for this LD.</p>
<h2>The ideas felt a bit blurry, but we move on</h2>
<p>We decided to think about our current situation. These months of march and april were really special for us. Gabriel started participating in <a title="Pixel Dailies Twitter" href="https://twitter.com/Pixel_Dailies" target="_blank">#pixel_dailies</a> and I started as well to help him and SheetColdGames out. This gave us not only some followers, but some insight about the work of other indie devs along the way. So we decided to work on something less serious, we were already doing something serious to be released and we thought that maybe we could have some fun and practice with this LD. If people hate it, if it is buggy or anything, it doesn't matter. At least we'll have some fun. So we decided to work on a theme based on a mysterious man with a crow mask that throws chickens on skeletons that decided to bother his calm life near the graveyard. We didn't think of details at that time, and more than 15 hours of LD had already passed. I had only a square on the screen and decided to implement some basic mechanics, but everything was still quite not clear. Anyway, Gabriel thinks of the main character in a monochromatic way, which is a good think, cause it helps him becoming a better artist. I was pretty calm at the time, I never actually wanted to do this theme and all, but after a good sleep (and by good, I mean almost 10 hours), I was ready to code until I was dead tired. So after some time thinking of what I should do next after I handled the collisions and the chicken throwing, I decided to have the brilliant idea of having an in game editor so people could tweak the only level of the game and have some fun with debugging and trolling their friends. Anyway, it was a nice concept, but extremely risky! I have already done a collision editor before, but it was buggy, could I make not only the walls editor, but the scenario editor as well? You will see that some things never change and my way of thinking I'm the superman is one of them.</p>
<h2>The editor sounded like a good idea. Oh, it was so cool! Oh, what a terrible idea!</h2>
<p>So coding the editor was surprisingly fun! Specially when you don't have to care about the looks of the code. Even though it was a game jam, it was still a surprisingly good looking editor in the ins and outs. I mean, it didn't feature any explanation on how to use it IN the editor, but give me a break. The editor I coded first was the collision walls editor. This editor was inspired by the UbiArt Framework videos I've seen. So collisions are handled in lines which you control the points. The secret of my collision detection is an ArrayList (for non Java people, this is a dynamic array) of LinkedLists. Why did I do this way? I think it's better to leave this explanation on some later article.</p>
<p>After that, I thought about the editor of the characters, but since I was dead tired from the other editor, I decided to leave this later cause my body was not responding well for almost 30 hours awoken with only 2 hours of rest. So I decided to take some nap and GODDAMN six hours of sleep, how much time til LD ends? 10 hours?! Ok ok, I just needed the character editor, the map editor... The renderer for the character. The enemies abilities, the boss... The level design.... Well, well... well. I thought I could do this!!!</p>
<p>Ten hours and lots of stuff to do, I thought I was gonna probably hate this...</p>
<h2>Near the end, an internal surprise. A good surprise</h2>
<p>So I don't recall eating too much, oh yeah, cause I didn't. I ate a piece of bread after I woke up and went straight into the computer to program. Only a miracle would bring a game with all of those things that were missing, but I needed to get them done somehow. While I was with Gabriel (art) on Skype, we didn't had too much time to think of a game, we had already that, but something was different. Something interesting was happening. We were actually enjoying that theme, somehow. We never actually think of dumb things to implement, but that was fun. And even though I was getting more and more stressed out (probably cause my back was killing me after hours sitting in the same position), I was happy with the result. We had definitely turned out something that we hate it into something that we loved. And somehow the game was coming together, the physics were a mess, the character didn't feature all the animations, AI was batshit dumb, we missed the background and there were no SFX (I even forgot the music on one of the build fixes!), but it was fun and we were laughing until the 2 final hours.</p>
<p>In the last hour before the release, Gabriel lost internet connection, I still didn't have a map design editor and that made finishing the game with something playable a hard test. By then we're here having almost nothing if the main game was not finished. By some blessing, Gabriel's internet comes back with a small draft of a map in Tiled. That was enough to say that we actually created something. Now we could release the project as something small. I put a small track together, and we are up and running</p>
<h2>After the end: stress and joy mashes together. But something doesn't feel right... At least for me</h2>
<p>When the deadline arrived, it didn't feel like the end. I needed to definitely work more in the game, the final editor was not done, there were no SFX, the AI needed improvement, we needed a boss and etc... But something felt wrong.</p>
<p>I wanted to make the editor, making editors was fun and all, but I didn't want to rush because of the game. Even though the game was funny, it didn't mean that I was excited to move along. And here's where Rafael as a person probably didn't change. I remember the last LD where I put all my efforts to make Beneath Lights more interesting, really, I'm talking 3 days of effort. There was an internal motivation in terms of making people understand what I was trying to implement and that made me worry if it was good enough or not.</p>
<p>At one point, I believe it was good, at the other point... I really don't know. What I know is that I wasn't motivated to finish this last LD32 and I probably won't be. That's the reason making games is sort of difficult for me. I have to balance this underlying thin line of gameplay and story. You might say I'm completely wrong. Other SCG fellows might also disagree. But that is just me. I like the technical difficulties of games, even though it is cool to remove one of the difficulties, it is also less motivating for me. So I'd probably do something harder to create in terms of concepts and ideas than just something technical. Call me crazy. Anyway, <a href="http://gamejolt.com/games/platformer/the-silent-rage-of-the-chicken-throwing-crow-masked-man/61783/" target="_blank">the game is available to download here through GameJolt</a>. Depending on how things go in the future, I might even just finish this game, who knows?</p>
<p>More updates about what we're up to coming soon!</p>
