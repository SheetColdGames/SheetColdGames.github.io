<p>So, I (Rafael) was working on some tech to help me develop games faster such as a general purpose physics editor, and I was working on another secret project (that I might show to the public later this year), when I saw someone talking about an event that was about to happen in a month here in Brazil: the <strong>SBGames 2014</strong>.</p>
<p>"What is this?", you might ask. It's an event held annually here in Brazil which started in 2002 and helps propagate the game culture in my country. Anyway, I saw an oportunity there, but only a month. Can I do it? I'll be sharing my thoughts through this sequences of posts.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Well, we have to start somewhere (it has to start sometime. What better place than here? What better time than now?). We needed to think of a game, instead of coming with something entirely new, maybe I should make Silver Lining in the way I was envisioning in the Global Game Jam (which unfortunately can't even be a game :/)</p>
