<p>On this post I'll show the creation of a crazy idea I had for developing a curriculum in a shape of a game. I swear this idea just popped out of my head when I was thinking of a way to gather the attention of my interviewers. I really want to get into the industry with an idea complete of my own. But I also want to learn more with other people: deadlines, team work, limitations, schedules. And even though I have my small team of friends. Work with new people always brings new experience (good or bad, still experience).</p>
<p>After trying and failing on new game ideas specially because of my limitations as a newbie programmer, I feel comfortable now to work on something new to show to other people.</p>
<p>Here we have the skeleton of my first prototype</p>
