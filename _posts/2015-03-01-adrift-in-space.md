<p>Concept implemented for the <a href="https://itch.io/jam/gdp-space-jam" target="_blank">GDP Space Jam</a> that Rafael had for LD30 theme Connected Worlds which he couldn't implement for thinking it was too complex. He did all the concept for the full game in five hours. The rest of the time was doing star effects, collectible effects, the OST and polishing the controls to make a little fairer. The game is quite complicated and practically unbeatable for most people.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://itch.io/jam/gdp-space-jam" target="_blank">GDP Space Jam</a> happened on February 27th to March 1st</p>
