<p>Hey, Rafael here. Well, I've decided to take a little break from the project I'm currently working on to try to create something real fast for the Ludum Dare, it'll be in the next friday (25).</p>
<p>I'm currently working with LibGDX and just can't believe of how much I've learned since the Global Game Jam. I was working on a game that I'll upload not so far from now, and since it's been giving me a hard time, I decided to take this last week to make a real fast game. So I implemented all the basic things that a game needs to have (I guess): map rendering, animated sprites, text rendering, lights and, of course, music. I developed a clever way to quickly type the coordinates from Tiled to a bunch of Vector2s (even though it would be a lot more clever to just convert the tiled map to a collision map too, but I'll do that later).</p>
<p>This week was kinda crazy, LibGDX's gone 1.0 and I'm still going to go old school for this Ludum Dare, and hope the game will be available for the three platforms it supports (still didn't test how to export the GWT versions of my game projects). I might sound like a noob, but I know I can get things to work right after some time</p>
