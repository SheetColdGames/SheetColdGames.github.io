<p>We've put Silver Lining to the side a little bit and decided to work on something diffrerent. Something a little more... casual.</p>
<p><strong>Big Yellow Mouth</strong> will be the first official game from the Seven Bits subsidiary. Seven Bits is sort of a catalog game for us, so we know what kind of game we are creating. The aim of Seven Bits is to produce more retro styled game. So anything with pixel art and chiptune music is (probably) part of Seven Bits.</p>
<p>We decided to think of the games as a progressive way of creating. That means that even if Big Yellow Mouth looks simple and childish now, the next game will always push the boundaries of our skills in a way that still makes the game fun to play.</p>
<h2>What is Big Yellow Mouth?</h2>
<p>Big Yellow Mouth is a game about two friends: Big Yellow Mouth and Borboleta. We're not sure what kind of animal is Big Yellow Mouth. All we know is that he is big, he is yellow and has a big mouth as well. They both live in the forest and, somehow, got lost in it. Now they need to find their way home facing the hazards of getting back home.</p>
<p>Big Yellow Mouth is not the smartest type of creature you'd find, but he is big and strong. Borboleta, on the other hand, is really smart, but not so strong, since she is just a butterfly.</p>
<p>Big Yellow Mouth always want to be together with Borboleta, but since he is not very smart, he can't find the best path for following her. Borboleta knows that, so she always tries to be in a position that will make her friend follow her without falling to his death. Even though she could just fly home easily, she can't leave her friend behind, and this is where the game starts off.</p>
<h2>How do we play this game?</h2>
<p>The game mechanics are fairly simple. You simply use your finger/mouse to indicate where the butterfly should be. Big Yellow Mouth will always try to stay at the same direction horizontally, but never vertically (since he's not so smart). He's able to jump and climb so you must use that in your favor to help our big friend to come back home safe</p>
<h2>About the development</h2>
<p>The game is being developed by Rafael and Gabriel and they are using LibGDX and Paint.NET to develop the game.</p>
<p>Gabriel created the original concept for Big Yellow Mouth as a small joke. After he told Rafael about the game, Rafael saw a potential mobile game for it. Rafael started mocking the game mechanics on LibGDX using Box2D, after some days, there was a draft</p>
