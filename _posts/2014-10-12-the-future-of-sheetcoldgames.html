<p>Hello, Rafael here again. This time, I want to show where SheetColdGames is heading. We've been without an update for a long time. But now I want to make a statement of what we are going to do in the near future.</p>
<p><!--more--></p>
<p>We learned a lot about gaming this year. But this (stiil) is not an end of year reflection. We just want to point out what we intend to do, so that it will become more clear to people (and ourselves).</p>
<p>At the end of our <a title="GBJam3 review and future plans" href="http://sheetcoldgames.wordpress.com/2014/10/12/gbjam3-review-and-future-plans/" target="_blank">last post</a> we briefly talked about the future of what we are going to do. We intend to continue to make games, but this time, we're heading into a clearer direction. And by that, I mean we are studying to develop a system to create our games, i.e. a framework, an engine.</p>
<p>Right now we are using libGDX to develop all the games that we had done so far, not only that, but all of our games we're created for game development events that required some theme or limitations. Even though limitations are fun to push ourselves creatively. It is not very solid for people who are learning how to make games.</p>
<p>The logic behind the creation of a game, itself, is pretty hard</p>
<p>We've said in our about page that "<em>We are passionate by games that have an extra sense of art and the technology behind them</em>"</p>
