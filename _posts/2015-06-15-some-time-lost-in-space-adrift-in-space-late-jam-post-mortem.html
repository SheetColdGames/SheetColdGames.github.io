<p>Hi, everyone! Rafael here. I'd like to cover all of the games I've worked on before moving on to other projects, just so I can have all these stuff documented. Anyway. I'll be talking about a game that I've made this year in late february/early march for The GDP Space Jam here in Rio de Janeiro: Adrift In Space.</p>
<p><!--more--></p>
<p>Now this will bring a few questions. First I think it is important that you <a title="Adrift in Space homepage" href="http://giordanno92.itch.io/adrift-in-space" target="_blank">play the game</a> (I think that if you're reading this, you've probably already played it). One thing you should take notice first hand is that everything in the game is wrong and does not fulfill my entire vision. Every single thing in it did not represent what I wanted to tell, but it was amazing how this little concept came out so fast and had so many cool features implemented (at least in my opinion) like the effects of the collectibles and the dynamic music. Not only that, but also the fact that the game menu comes straight from the game without flashes nor anything. Not something mindblowing for games, but how everything came together in less than 2 days still impresses me 2 months after its release. And I think it is the most complete jam game I've made so far. It seemed like everything was managed to be made in two days. It's been quite some time since I played it and it holds a special place in my heart. You might know the reason soon.</p>
<p>Let's take it step by step though</p>
<h2>What's the GDP Space Jam???</h2>
<p>Ok, I think it is important to get this out of the way soon. In the middle of this ever growing sea of game jams, we might get confused. Anyway... <strong>GDP</strong> stands for <strong>G</strong>ame <strong>D</strong>evelopment <strong>P</strong>roject and it is a group maintained by undergraduated students of the UFRJ (Federal University of Rio de Janeiro). There's a reason for why I know them, Jo√£o Vitor is currently studying there and told me about a game jam that was supposed to happen there. I've participated in a jam that they hosted previously, but I worked making sounds for them. The second time I've talked to them, I made more sounds and music for the 7DFPS. And the last time I did something with them was in this Space Jam. So they decided to get more organized and used itch io to host a jam about space. You could make any game with it, the theme was just space and we got twelve nice games to play. Now, I'll talk a bit about how Adrift In Space came together.</p>
<h2>The Connected Worlds</h2>
<p>The game is not about just space nor it is about being just adrift in space. I could say what the game is all about, but it wouldn't make much sense. It's not that game out there available to download, it's a different game. But where did this game come from? Back when I finished Clockwork Gear Hunters, I was hungry for more stuff and in less than two weeks, we'd have the LD30, I really needed to be a part of it. When the theme was released, though, I didn't know what should I do about it. I spent a lot of time thinking of something and when I finally had an idea, it was very difficult for me to implement. And I didn't know what to focus first, I had a plot, but I didn't know if the gameplay would be fun. So I gave up on the second day and never touched the idea again. It was there, "documented", so maybe I would do something about it, who knows...</p>
<h2>It's been a few months, maybe I can make something about that idea...</h2>
<p>So the GDP Space Jam was announced and I really didn't want to be a part of it, I mean, I loved the theme space. But I wasn't feeling quite well to create anything. Two days or so prior to the event, I'd bought the <a href="http://www.supergamejam.com/" target="_blank">Super Game Jam</a> documentary. I had already watched the first one for free, but didn't think of watching the second episode until one day before the jam started. The game made by Christoffer Hedborg and Dominik Johann about a guy travelling on his planet using his seeds to boost the direction of where he is going (it might be hard to picture that, but it is easier if you watch the episode :P) made me remember of the old document containing the idea for the LD30 game and then I thought "why not"? So when the jam started, I set up to see whether I could or couldn't actually create that game. And in five hours, the whole prototype was practically done, including small effects and all... And everything in a single class file! So then, yeah, I could make the basics of the game, 'twas time to polish it.</p>
<p>After one hour remaking the source code to be able to receive more changes and etc. I decided to take some sleep and try to make more stuff when I wake up.</p>
<p>I decided to finally understand what to make in terms of gameplay and story, but I didn't push myself too much in that jam and I was having a problem with the movement of the astronaut. I needed to know a little bit more of math, but I also needed to make other stuff, like game states, music and the art of the astronaut itself. Work with circles and rotating rectangles was all pretty new to me.</p>
<p>But it seemed like the game really needed to come out, I received a help from a friend called <a href="https://www.facebook.com/bvieiracosta" target="_blank">Bruno Vieira Costa</a>, he's an undergraduated at IME (Military Institute of Engineering) and is incredible when it comes to the technical part of programming and mathematics in general. He offered to help me out, I addressed the problem and he fixed it until the next morning. He wanted to make more, but he was busy with college and his code literally changed the entire game from something frustrating to "that was totally the player's fault". In the mean time, I started with music and level creation.</p>
<h2>So what were the problems faced during the game creation?</h2>
<p>What's the catch and the general idea? The game turned out to be about a circle collecting squares under a certain amount of time, after that, you move to another planet, where you collect more squares and you do that until you get a high score. It feels very acarde-ish. Well, it's what I could do in two days. The original story and theming behind the game is deeper than this. I'm not really sure how deep, and I think I already spoiled a lot of it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>What? So now I'm finally making music?!</h2>
<p>For the first time ever in my history of game jams I made music and programmed on the same entry. But the music of the game proved to be</p>
