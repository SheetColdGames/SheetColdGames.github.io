<p>Rafael here. It's been quite some time since our last update. But this blog post is intended to show what we did and what we have in mind for the near future.</p>
<p>So, now there'll be some jams in a few days (GBJam, Ludum Dare 30), and we can sum up everything so far to <em>FAIL</em> (or maybe trial and error).</p>
<p><!--more--></p>
<p>Since our last game on the <em>Ludum Dare</em>, we really wanted to break free from <em>Box2D</em>, since it is just too much for fake physics platformers. With that, came an idea that we could create something new and better, but it's just not that simple. So I tried to implement the programming part of a full fledged physics for a platformer game . I developed the map editor and created something quite good that relies on the size of the character sprite (at will) to develop the collision box, which is quite good for movement and fighting games. But to get that right took some time. I re-programmed everything three times and I am about to do it again for the fourth time because of the latest inclusion of an entity system on libGDX 1.2 (I don't know if it's good to use it, but I have to try it anyway).</p>
<p>So, basically what we were trying to do was to develop a game similar to the ones that we did on LD and GGJ, but we couldn't. Not only because programming and creating art is hard, but because the themes behind Beneath Lights and Silver Lining are hard to implement in a way that the game makes sense and it's fun to play. It's not like we can't make a simple platformer with a corky sense of humor. It's just that is going to be a project where we might dedicate months of our lives to create it, so we can't just make something that we don't feel proud of.</p>
<p>Now let's talk about the future, and the future is our debut at GBJam and the new Ludum Dare.</p>
<p><a href="http://jams.gamejolt.io/gbjam3" target="_blank">GBJam </a>is an event held by <a href="http://gamejolt.com/" target="_blank">GameJolt</a> which consists of developing a game using the game boy audio and video limitations. I believe this compo is really important for us, because the limitations are so big that we don't even need to care about other graphical stuff, like lights and such. I'm intending to work on the project solo, making the art assets and the music as well. João Vitor might work on the project as soon as he got time (he's really busy with college and internship), but he'll try come up with other game. So, at best, we might see two new SCG games in 13 days.</p>
<p>The game boy is quite an impressive device to tackle on, it has only four colors (three for drawing and one for the background). Its sound chip has the same architecture of the NES, except that it doesn't have a triangle wave form. I'm intending to use <a href="http://famitracker.com/" target="_blank">Famitracker</a> to compose, and to achieve that sound, we have to create a new FDS channel and make it sound similar to the original thing. Good thing we have lots of infos on the web.</p>
<p>For the game, I am intending to make a strategy game. So I'm assembling a small engine to achieve that. I'm also drawing the skeleton character for the other characters, since the perspective is different from a platformer. I'm going with a Shadowrun perspective on the game, but since the GB screen is so tiny (160x144) we'll have a really small character (16x16). I'm still working on the code to make the pallete swap and as always I'm intending to make a full game (even though it might be small like the previous games). It'll be a great learning experience for me and I hope everybody likes the final product.</p>
<p>Next, we have Ludum Dare 30. But what can we say about this one? This time, João Vitor will participate on the 72h jam compo and I'm going to tackle on the 48h solo compo. I know it's a huge leap, but I'm confident of the power of the engine that I'm assembling so far, so does João Vitor. Even though all the code should be rewritten for the 48h compo, I'm confident that I'll be able to remake everything, it's good practice. Expect a new platform game coming from us.</p>
<p>So, be happy! SheetColdGames might bring four new games this month (two or three in the worst case). We hope you guys have lots of fun while playing them and I'll see you on the GBJam update!</p>
